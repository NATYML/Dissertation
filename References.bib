Exploring intergalactic medium (IGM) ionization states ranging from an almost neutral to a fully ionized one, we find that including (excluding) the effects of clustered sources the first local group progenitor appears as a LAE for a neutral hydrogen fraction of 0.4 (0.1). This number increases to 5 progenitors each of the MW and M31 being visible as LAEs for a completely ionized IGM; the contribution from clustered sources is crucial in making many of the progenitors visible in the Lyman Alpha, for all the ionization states considered. We also put constrains on the physical properties of such progenitors. Finally, we find that the number density of these LAEs are higher than that of general field LAEs (observed in cosmological volumes) by about two (one) orders of magnitude for a neutral hydrogen fraction of 10^-5 (0.4). Detections of such high LAE number densities at z ~ 6 would be a clear signature of an over-dense region that could evolve and resemble the local group volume at z=0.",

@Misc{ clustering,
	abstract = {We present a physically motivated semi-analytic model to understand the clustering of high redshift LBGs. We show that the model parameters constrained by the observed luminosity function, can be used to predict large scale (\theta > 80 arcsec) bias and angular correlation function of galaxies. These predictions are shown to reproduce the observations remarkably well. We then adopt these model parameters to calculate the halo occupation distribution (HOD) using the conditional mass function. The halo model using this HOD is shown to provide a reasonably good fit to the observed clustering of LBGs at both large (\theta>80") and small (\theta < 10") angular scales for z=3-5 and several limiting magnitudes. However, our models underpredict the clustering amplitude at intermediate angular scales, where quasi-linear effects are important. The average mass of halos contributing to the observed clustering is found to be 6.2 x 10^{11} M\_{\o}dot and the characteristic mass of a parent halo hosting satellite galaxies is 1.2 \times 10^{12} M\_{\o}dot for a limiting absolute magnitude of -20.5 at z=4. For a given threshold luminosity these masses decrease with increasing z and at any given z these are found to increase with increasing value of threshold luminosity. We find that approximately 40 \% of the halos above a minimum mass M\_{min}, can host detectable central galaxies and about 5-10 \% of these halos are likely to also host a detectable satellite. The satellites form typically a dynamical timescale prior to the formation of the parent halo. The small angular scale clustering is due to central-satellite pairs and is quite sensitive to changes in the duration of star formation in a halo. The present data favor star formation in a halo lasting typically for a few dynamical time-scales. Our models also reproduce different known trends between parameters related to star formation.},

@Misc{ verhamme,
	abstract = "[abridged] Aims. The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of the interstellar medium (ISM) physics on Lyman-alpha (Lya) radiation transfer and to quantify how galaxy orientation with respect to the line of sight alters observational signatures. Methods. We compare the results of Lya radiation transfer calculations through the ISM of a couple of idealized galaxy simulations with different ISM models. Results. First, the small-scale structuration of the ISM plays a determinant role in shaping a galaxys Lya properties.The artificially warm, and hence smooth, ISM of G1 yields an escape fraction of 50 percent at the Lya line center, and produces symmetrical double-peak profiles. On the contrary, in G2, most young stars are embedded in thick star-forming clouds, and the result is a 10 times lower escape fraction. G2 also displays a stronger outflowing velocity field, which favors the escape of red-shifted photons, resulting in an asymmetric Lya line. Second, the Lya properties of G2 strongly depend on the inclination at which it is observed: From edge-on to face-on, the line goes from a double-peak profile with an equivalent width of -5 Angstrom to a 15 times more luminous red-shifted asymmetric line with EW 90 Angstrom. Conclusions. Lya radiation transfer calculations can only lead to realistic properties in simulations where galaxies are resolved into giant molecular clouds, putting these calculations out of reach of current large scale cosmological simulations. Finally, we find inclination effects to be much stronger for Lya photons than for continuum radiation. This could potentially introduce severe biases in the selection function of narrow-band Lya emitter surveys, which could indeed miss a significant fraction of the high-z galaxy population.",

We show that the model parameters constrained by the observed luminosity functions, can be used to predict large scale bias and angular correlation function of LAEs. These predictions are shown to reproduce the observations remarkably well. We find that average masses of dark matter halos hosting LAEs brighter than threshold narrow band magnitude ~ 25 are ~ 10^11 M\_{\o}dot. These are smaller than that of typical Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) brighter than similar threshold continuum magnitude by a factor ~ 10. This results in a smaller clustering strength of LAEs compared to LBGs. However, using the observed relationship between UV continuum and Lyman-alpha luminosity of LAEs, we show that both LAEs and LBGs belong to the same parent galaxy population with narrow band techniques having greater efficiency in picking up galaxies with low UV luminosity. We also show that the lack of evidence for the presence of the one halo term in the observed LAE angular correlation functions can be attributed to sub-Poisson distribution of LAEs in dark matter halos as a result of their small halo occupations.",

	abstract = "We present a simple physical model for populating dark matter halos with Lyman Alpha Emiiters(LAEs) and predict the physical properties of LAEs at z~3-7. The central tenet of this model is that the Ly-alpha luminosity is proportional to the star formation rate (SFR) which is directly related to the halo mass accretion rate. The only free parameter in our model is then the star-formation efficiency (SFE). An efficiency of 2.5\% provides the best-fit to the Ly-alpha luminosity function (LF) at redshift z=3.1, and we use this SFE to construct Ly-alpha LFs at other redshifts. Our model reproduce the Ly-alpha LFs, stellar ages, SFR ~1-10; Msun/yr, stellar masses ~ 10^7-10^8 Msun and the clustering properties of LAEs at z~3-7. We find the spatial correlation lengths ro ~ 3-6 Mpc/h, in agreement with the observations. Finally, we estimate the field-to-field variation ~ 30\% for current volume and flux limited surveys, again consistent with observations. Our results suggest that the star formation, and hence Ly-alpha emission in LAEs is powered by the accretion of new material, and that the physical properties of LAEs do not evolve significantly over a wide range of redshifts. Relating the accreted mass, rather than the total mass of halos, to the Ly-alpha luminosity of LAEs naturally gives rise to the duty cycle of LAEs.",

@Misc{ rhoads,
	abstract = {We present the first dynamical mass measurements for Lyman alpha galaxies at high redshift, based on velocity dispersion measurements from rest-frame optical emission lines and size measurements from HST imaging, for a sample of nine galaxies drawn from four surveys. These measurements enable us to study the nature of Lyman alpha galaxies in the context of galaxy scaling relations. The resulting dynamical masses range from 1e9 to 1e10 solar masses. We also fit stellar population models to our sample, and use them to plot the Lyman alpha sample on a stellar mass vs. line width relation. Overall, the Lyman alpha galaxies follow well the scaling relation established by observing star forming galaxies at lower redshift (and without regard for Lyman alpha emission), though in 1/3 of the Lyman alpha galaxies, lower-mass fits are also acceptable. In all cases, the dynamical masses agree with established stellarmass-linewidth relation. Using the dynamical masses as an upper limit on gas mass, we show that Lyman alpha galaxies resemble starbursts (rather than "normal" galaxies) in the relation between gas mass surface density and star formation activity, in spite of relatively modest star formation rates. Finally, we examine the mass densities of these galaxies, and show that their future evolution likely requires dissipational ("wet") merging. In short, we find that Lyman alpha galaxies are low mass cousins of larger starbursts.},
